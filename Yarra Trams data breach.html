          <p>The personal email addresses of nearly 100 people have been exposed by Yarra Trams in yet another data breach involving Victorian commuters.</p>
          In an email from a Yarra Trams officer to 91 commuters rejecting their compensation requests on Friday, the private email addresses of each of the commuters was exposed.</p>
          <p>The email was sent about 3pm and was followed up by another message 15 minutes later, in which the company attempted to recall the email but instead sent another note exposing the list of private addresses.</p>
          <p>One commuter, who requested to be known only as John, said he was furious that his private details had been exposed against his will.</p>
          <p>"I'm very disappointed that Yarra Trams was releasing my personal information," John said.</p>
          <p>"Yarra Trams had got a privacy policy which they're obviously not following and that information was shared with a large number of other members of the public."</p>
          <p>Some commuters were entitled to claim a free trip after Yarra Trams failed to deliver enough of its scheduled services in December last year.</p>
          <p>Any tram passenger with a myki pass for 28 days or more and who touched on at least 10 times in December was eligible for compensation.</p>
          <p>However, 91 of the commuters who applied for compensation were found to be ineligible.</p>
          <p>Public Transport Users Association spokesman Daniel Bowen said transport operators must "take the utmost care with private data such as email addresses".</p>
          <p>"This breach shows they need to review their procedures and staff training to ensure a similar mistake does not happen again.

		  "It also raises the question of why passengers need to apply for compensation in the first place. Myki data is used to verify the eligibility of those who apply â€“ it should be used to proactively pay compensation to all eligible passengers."</p>

          <p>
            It comes months after Public Transport Victoria and the Department of Premier and Cabinet gave a hacking and data science conference unfettered access to travel data stored on about 15 million myki cards used in the three years to June 2018.</p>

            The 1.8 billion "touch-on" and "touch-off" events on the cards included information about a commuter's route and stop number and the specific train they were on.
          <p>
           The Office of the Victorian Information Commissioner released a stinging report on the extraordinary breach last year.
          </p>
          <p>
            A Yarra Trams spokesman confirmed an employee had exposed the email addresses of those who had their compensation claims rejected.
          </p>
          <p>
            "Yarra Trams would like to apologise to everyone who received the email regarding unsuccessful compensation claims," the spokesman said. "We will be putting in place more thorough checks and balances to ensure this does not happen again."
          </p>
          <p>
            A spokeswoman for the Victorian Information Commissioner said the office had not yet been contacted by Yarra Trams or those affected by the breach.
